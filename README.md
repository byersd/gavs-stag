### Old Town
Action is centred in the medieval Old Town (Altstadt), originally located within the old town walls, which have long ceded to a ring road. A pedestrian thoroughfare spans Karlstor on the west side (near the train station) and Isartor on the east side of the ring. Walk it in about 15 minutes, taking in the main shops and many of the major landmarks. The circular Altstadt is only about one square kilometre, but this small area has enough shops, theatres, museums, historical sites, churches and beer gardens to attract 300,000 visitors a day.

### Schwabing
Just a few minutes from Marienplatz by U-Bahn, the old artists' quarter of Munich offers welcome respite from the heaving masses in the city centre. This popular district is home to the Ludwig Maximilian University and, hardly surprising, is a paradise for bookworms and café goers. Its streets abound with bookstores, record and antique shops, boutiques and pubs. A little farther north is Schwabing's main strip, Leopoldstraße. Crowding both sides of the bustling boulevard and its side streets are scores of cafés with outdoor seating, boutiques, bars and nightclubs. It's a great place to stroll on warm summer nights. The Englischer Garten, a huge city park, straddles Schwabing to the East.
